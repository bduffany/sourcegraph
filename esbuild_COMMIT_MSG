TODOs
- Resolve alias:
  // react-visibility-sensor's main field points to a UMD bundle instead of ESM
      // https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor/issues/148
      'react-visibility-sensor': path.resolve(
        rootDirectory,
        'node_modules/react-visibility-sensor/visibility-sensor.js'
      ),
- Worker loader
- Omit from utility-types is unnecessary, it's now builtin
